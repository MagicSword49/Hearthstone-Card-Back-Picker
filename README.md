# Hearthstone-Card-Back-Picker
Through a series of binary choices, you can figure out your favorite card back.
Basically ripped straight from here: https://github.com/antialiasis/favorite-picker
All 140 currently available cardbacks (and the cardback available at the end of May, making 141) are here.
This was just a fun little thing I did inspired by this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/glyiea/all_card_backs_which_one_is_your_fav/
If the wiki ever changes how/where it stores the images, the program shouldn't break, but it will look bad. Oops.
I might work on a more permanent thing later - maybe a dedicated website. We'll see.
